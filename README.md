# 💻 Low-Level Programming Projects (Assembly)

## Overview

This repository features a collection of **practical exercises and projects** implemented in **Assembly language** to demonstrate proficiency in **low-level programming** and a strong understanding of **Computer Systems Architecture**.

This material was developed during the 'Computer Systems Organization' discipline, which is part of the Computer Engineering program at the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC-Campinas).

## 🚀 Key Skills Demonstrated

The projects within this repository highlight practical experience in:

* **Low-Level Programming:** Writing efficient code by directly controlling memory and registers.
* **Computer Architecture:** Deep understanding of the processor's instruction set and execution flow.
* **Software-Hardware Interaction:** Comprehension of how high-level concepts (like loops and functions) are translated into machine code.
* **Optimization:** Techniques for writing concise and performant routines.
